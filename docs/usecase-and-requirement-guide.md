# Create a glossary

A glossary can be created multiple ways, this tutorial show the simplest one. In EA the definitions are modeled by classes with *\<\<GlossaryEntry\>\>* stereotype. The name of the class is the defined expression and the note of the class is the definition of the expression. The glossary entries are organized into categories, which are packages with the *\<\<GlossaryCategory\>\>* stereotype. The glossary is an UML class diagram, which is in "*Specification View*".

1. Create a package and select the "*Select and Apply Model Pattern*".

1. Choose the "*SysML Glossary*" pattern. This pattern will create a simple glossary with the definitions of the SysML's modeling elements. Click on "*Create Model*"-
![Alt text](figs/ea-uc-and-req-modeling/image-1.png)
1. Right click on the glossary diagram and select "*Switch View/Graphical View*".
![Alt text](figs/ea-uc-and-req-modeling/image-2.png)
1. Delete all the glossary entries except one and rename the remaining entry and modify its note. Using the toolbox you can add new categories and entries. After you finished the glossary definitions change the view of the diagram back to "*Specification*" mode.

1. Alternatively you can add glossary entries if you set the perspective into "*Publishing/Glossary*" and click on "*Add New*".

# Use case modeling

1. Create a SysML use case diagram and define some use cases using the Toolbox. Add some notes to the use cases.
![Alt text](figs/ea-uc-and-req-modeling/image-5.png)
1. Define the actors, the boundaries of the system using and the relations between the modeling elements using the Toolbox.
![Alt text](figs/ea-uc-and-req-modeling/image-6.png)
1. Create another usecase diagram and pull the previously defined usecases into the diagram. You may give the diagram a name similar to "*Use case specifications*".
![Alt text](figs/ea-uc-and-req-modeling/image-7.png)
1. Change the view of the diagram into "*Specification View*".

## Scenarios of the use cases
1. If you double-click on any usecase, then the EA will automatically open the "*Scenario Specification*" of the selected use case.
![](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image.png)
1. In the newly opened "*Scenario*" window you can specify the basic path of the use case. You can add steps to the path if you write the name of the step in the "*new step*" field. Additionally, you can specify the used and resulted objects of the step in the "*Uses*" and "*Results*" columns, respectively. You can use the "*State*" column to specify that the step occurs in which state of the system.
![Alt text](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image-1.png)
2. If you select a step, then you can move the step forward and backward using the green arrows in the top menu bar.
![Alt text](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image-2.png)
3. If you select a step, then you can add alternate and exception paths using the yellow and orange path icons in the top menu bar.
![Alt text](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image-3.png)
1. If you create an alternate or exception path then you can add steps to the path in the table. You can select different paths in the "*Enty Points*" tab below the table of steps. If you select a path then you can change the type (basic/alternate/exception) and the name of the path in the "*Type*" and "*Scenario*" fields.
![Alt text](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image-4.png)
1. After you created the paths and steps of the paths,then you can generate anactivity diagram from the scenario definition by clicking to the diagram icon and select "*Activity with ActivityParameter*". This command will automatically create an activity and a UML Activity diagram.   
![Alt text](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image-5.png)
2. In the diagram, each step is an activity action and the in- and output of the actions are activity parameters. The alternate and exception paths are transformed into "*decision*" control nodes. 
![Alt text](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image-6.png)
3. You can visualize the inputs and the outputs of the activities if you select an actions and in "*Interaction Points*" tab of the Features window turn on the visibility of the activity parameters. Thereafter, you can connect the activity parameters with object flow.![Alt text](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image-7.png)
4. Alternatively, you can generate a statemachine diagram from the scenarions. In the statemachine diagram, the transitions are generated from the actions and the states of the diagram are defined by the "*State*" column of the scenario table.

## Constraints of use cases

1. If you double-click on any usecase, then the EA will automatically open the "*Scenario Specification*" of the selected use case.
![](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image.png)
1. In the "*Constraints*" tab of the "*Scenario*" window you can specify the constraints of the use cases. 
![Alt text](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image-10.png)
1. If you click on the "Add New" icon in the constraints tab you can add a constraint to the use case.
![Alt text](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image-11.png)
1. In the pop-up window you can specify the name of the constraint in the "*Constraint*" field and you can set the type (Invariant/Pre-condision/Post-condition) of the constraint in the "*Properties*" field. Below the name of the constraint you can add some notes to the constraint. You can set the changes by clicking on the "*Save*" button.
![Alt text](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image-12.png)
1. The new constraint will appear in the "*Constraints*" tab. You can edit existing constraints if you double click on the constraint.
![Alt text](figs/ea-scenarios-and-constraints/image-13.png)
1. Alternatively, you can add and modify constraints if you right click on a use case and select the "*Properties*" option and in the pop-up window you select the "*Responsibilities/Constraints*" tab.

# Requirement modeling

1. Create a requirement diagram. Define some requirements using the Toolbox.
![Alt text](figs/ea-uc-and-req-modeling/image-9.png)
1. In the Properties window set the ID of the requirement.
![Alt text](figs/ea-uc-and-req-modeling/image-10.png)
1. Set the Text of the requirement by clicking the three dot icon in the Properties window. In the pop-up window write the text of the requirement and press OK.
![Alt text](figs/ea-uc-and-req-modeling/image-11.png)
1. If the Text and the ID does not appear in the diagram, then click on the diagram, and in the Compartments tab of the Properties window turn on the visibility of tags.
![Alt text](figs/ea-uc-and-req-modeling/image-12.png)
1. For SysML Requirement Extensions the attributes of the requirements can be specified in the Properties window.
